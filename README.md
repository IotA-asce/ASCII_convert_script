the grayscale of individual pixel data is analysed for the brightness and a char value is assigned to it, ' ' for rgb(0, 0, 0) and '$' for rgb(255, 255, 255)
since all the pixels are mapped and converted to their char counterpart which taken up a lot more pixel as compared to a single pixel, the original image is to be scaled down to obtain legible ASCII counterpart
the font color is set according to the rgb of the pixel
